Completely revised and updated, this second edition takes into account new developments of the past four decades, especially regarding information technology. Central emphasis is placed on the use of the universal variable formulation, although classical methods are also discussed. The development of the basic two-body and n-body equations of motion serves as a foundation for all that follows. Subsequent topics include orbit determination and the classical orbital elements, coordinate transformations, and differential correction. The Kepler and Gauss problems are treated in detail, and two-body mechanics are applied to the ballistic missile problem. Perturbations, integration schemes and error, and analytic formulations of several common perturbations are introduced. Example problems and exercises appear throughout the text, along with photographs, diagrams, and drawings. Four helpful appendixes conclude the book"--},

	abstract = {The orbital boundary value problem, also known as Lambert Problem, is revisited. Building upon Lancaster and Blanchard approach, new relations are revealed and a new variable representing all problem classes, under L-similarity, is used to express the time of flight equation. In the new variable, the time of flight curves have two oblique asymptotes and they mostly appear to be conveniently approximated by piecewise continuous lines. We use and invert such a simple approximation to provide an efficient initial guess to an Householder iterative method that is then able to converge, for the single revoltuion case, in only two iterations. The resulting algorithm is compared to Gooding's procedure revealing to be numerically as accurate, while having a smaller computational complexity.},
