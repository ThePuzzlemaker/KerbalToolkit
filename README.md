# KerbalToolkit

KerbalToolkit is a work-in-progress mission planning and trajectory
design program for Kerbal Space Program.

KerbalToolkit requires [kRPC](https://github.com/krpc/krpc) and the
addon `KRPC.KerbTk` (available
[here](https://git.sr.ht/~thepuzzlemaker/krpc-kerbtk) or
[here](https://github.com/ThePuzzlemaker/krpc-kerbtk)). Additionally,
the patch in
[`0001-Editor-API-for-Part-Introspection.patch`][0001-Editor-API-for-Part-Introspection.patch]
must be applied to kRPC.

Please submit [issues][iss] and [patches][patch] through
